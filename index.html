                    <p class="lead mb-5">As a passionate and results-driven individual, I am pursuing a degree in Business Management at Brigham Young University. My academic experience has honed my leadership, decision-making, and critical thinking skills, which I believe would be a valuable addition to any business organization. 

                        With a background in customer service, sports, and academic excellence, I have developed discipline, time management, and teamwork skills, which I believe would make me a great fit for a variety of roles. Additionally, my multiple leadership roles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints have taught me how to guide and motivate large groups of people toward common goals. 
                        
                        I am committed to personal growth and self-improvement and am currently working towards obtaining a real estate license before graduation. In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, working out, and expanding my knowledge in finance.</p>
